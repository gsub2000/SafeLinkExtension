        <h2>How this extension works:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This extension highlights links on the page that can be dangerous.</li>
            <li>This is currently a prototype, so the AI machine isn't entirely accurate.</li>
            <li>Future versions will include different-colored highlight, a more accurate AI model, and more easily seen detection on the page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>(This project was made by a student and is still in-progress. For personal use only).</p>
